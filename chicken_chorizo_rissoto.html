            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>
                1) Dice onion and Garlic
                <br><br>2) Heat the oil in a large, non-stick pan on a medium/high heat and add onions until softened
                <br><br>3) Add garlic for 2 mins
                <br><br>4) Dice chicken into small bitesize pieces, add to pan and fry until cooked through
                <br><br>5) Add 600g boiling water to chicken OXO cubes, stirring well to make the stock 
                <br><br>6) Once the chicken has cooked add rice, tomato purée and 1 tbsp mixed herbs to the pan. Mix well and cook for 2 mins
                <br><br>7) Add passata and cook for 10 mins stirring continuously
                <br><br>8) Add chicken stock in 3rds, again stirring continuously. Add the next 3rd once most of the liquid has disappeared (whole process should take 40 mins ish). More boiling water can be added if rice isn't soft once all the stock has been used
                <br><br>9) With 10 mins or so left fry chorizo until cooked (chorizo can be cut to your liking if you've bought the sausage version)

                <br><br>13) Dry off Mozzarella balls and cut into slices (1 or 2 balls depending on how much you like)
                <br><br>14) Serve risotto placing mozzerella slices on top
