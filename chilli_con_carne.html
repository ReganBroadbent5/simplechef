                <br>2x Garlic cloves
                <br>2 tbsp Tomato purée
                <br>1/2 tsp Hot Chilli Powder**
                <br>2 tsp Mild Chilli Powder**

                <br>1x Beef Stock
            </p>  
            <h4>Staples:</h4>
            <p>
                Olive Oil
                <br>Salt
                <br>Pepper
                <br>Water
                <br>
                <br>* can use regular kidney beans instead and can use a smaller 200g can if you prefer
                <br>** can use any heat of chilli powder to your taste. SimpleChef finds the combination suggested not too hot but with a kick of heat
