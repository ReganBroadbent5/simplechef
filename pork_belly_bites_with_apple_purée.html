            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>
                1) Peel and slice the potatoes into thin slices roughly 4mm thick
                <br><br>2) Heat cream, milk and garlic in a saucepan until starting to simmer
                <br><br>3) Add sliced potatoes to the pan for 15 mins, stirring every few minutes
                <br><br>4) Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees 
                <br><br>5) Whilst the potatoes are in the pan, peel and core the apples and slice in half
                <br><br>6) Add apples into a bowl with the sugar, a pinch of salt and the cubed butter. Toss to mix everything together and transfer to a heatproof dish
                <br><br>7) Rub pork belly strips with salt, pepper and paprika and lie fat side up on a tin foiled baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil
                <br><br>8) Once the 15 mins are up on the potatoes transfer to an ovenproof dish, delicately creating layers of potatoes. Once half way add a layer of grated chese, then continue building layers of potato until all the potato is used
                <br><br>9) Pour over the cream mixture until it just about covers the potatoes and add another layer of cheese to the top
                <br><br>10) Put pork belly strips, apple mixture and dauphinoise potatoes into the oven. Pork and Potatoes for 45 minutes and appled for 25 minutes
                <br><br>11) After 25 minutes remove apple mixture from the oven and transfer contents to a blender, blend until smooth
                <br><br>12) Pass apple mixture through a fine sieve to further smooth the purée (apple purée now finished, can heat up in microwave for 30 seconds if cold by service)
                <br><br>13) Heat olive oil in a large flat pan on a medium flame, once hot add tenderstem brocolli with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 12 mins, flipping half way through
                <br><br>14) Remove pork belly strips and dauphinoise potatoes from ovenproof
                <br><br>15) Add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar onto the tenderstem broccoli for the last 30 seconds
                <br><br>16) To serve: Place the prok belly strips onto of the apple purée, slice the dauphinoise potatoes into even parts and add the broccoli
