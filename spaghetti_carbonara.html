            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>
                1) Add salt to a pan of water and bring to boil. Cook Spaghetti as per instructions
                <br><br>2) Beat eggs in a bowl and combine with the parmesan, whisking until fully combined
                <br><br>3) Peel and squash garlic cloves
                <br><br>4) Heat the butter with a tbsp of oil , once hot add pancetta and garlic for 5 mins
                <br><br>5) After 5 mins, remove garlic cloves and reduce temp to low
                <br><br>6) When the spaghetti is ready use tongs to transfer into pan with pancetta and mix, add pepper (you want some pasta water to be transferred during this process)
                <br><br>7) Fry on low heat for 1-2 mins
                <br><br>8) Add 5 tbsp of pasta water to the egg mixture, whisk well
                <br><br>9) Turn off heat on spaghetti and tip the egg mixture onto the spaghetti
                <br><br>10) Stir the mixture through the spaghetti, keep it moving to avoid the egg scrambling
                <br><br>11) Once mixed through, turn to low heat and keep stirring until hot (again do not let the egg scramble)
                <br><br>12) Bon App√©tit!
